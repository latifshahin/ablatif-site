  <h1>Bank Merger Safety in Bangladesh: What Happens to Your Money? (2026)</h1>
  <p class="meta">By <strong>Abdul Latif</strong> · Educational content · Updated 2026</p>

  <p>
    News about bank mergers often creates fear among customers in Bangladesh.
    People worry about their deposits, FDRs, loans, ATM cards, and account safety.
    This article explains <strong>what really happens</strong> during a bank merger and what customers should do.
  </p>

  <div class="note">
    <strong>Short answer:</strong> In a regulated bank merger, customer money does not disappear.
    Accounts, deposits, and obligations are transferred to the merged bank under regulatory supervision.
  </div>

  <h2>What Is a Bank Merger?</h2>
  <p>
    A bank merger happens when two banks combine into one entity.
    In Bangladesh, mergers usually occur under the supervision of <strong>Bangladesh Bank</strong>
    to improve financial stability.
  </p>

  <h2>Is Your Money Safe During a Bank Merger?</h2>
  <p>
    In a formal merger approved by regulators:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Customer deposits remain recorded</li>
    <li>Account balances are transferred to the new entity</li>
    <li>FDRs and savings accounts continue under revised terms</li>
    <li>Loans and obligations remain valid</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="warning">
    Problems usually arise from rumors or unofficial information.
    Always rely on official notices from banks and Bangladesh Bank.
  </div>

  <h2>What Happens to Different Banking Products?</h2>

  <h3>Savings & Current Accounts</h3>
  <p>
    Account numbers may change, but balances are transferred.
    Customers are informed before any major change.
  </p>

  <h3>Fixed Deposits (FDR)</h3>
  <p>
    Existing FDRs usually continue until maturity.
    Interest/profit terms are generally honored as per original agreement.
  </p>

  <h3>Loans & EMIs</h3>
  <p>
    Loan agreements remain valid.
    EMIs continue, and repayment schedules usually remain unchanged.
  </p>

  <h3>ATM Cards & Online Banking</h3>
  <p>
    Cards may continue temporarily, but customers may receive new cards or login details later.
  </p>

  <h2>Should You Withdraw Money During a Merger?</h2>
  <p>
    Panic withdrawals often create unnecessary stress.
    Unless there is an official instruction, mass withdrawal is usually not required.
  </p>

  <div class="note">
    Keep records, stay informed, and wait for official communication.
  </div>
